# GooglePlaySuccessDashboard

A Streamlit-based dashboard that predicts the favorability of an app on Google Play and provides actionable recommendations to improve its performance. The project uses a pre-trained logistic regression model, along with a data preprocessor and a set of threshold values for various app metrics.

## Overview

This dashboard allows users to input key characteristics of their app, such as:
- **App Rating**
- **Price (USD)**
- **App Age (Years)**
- **Time Since Last Update (Years)**
- **Content Rating**
- **Whether the App is Free**

Once the input data is provided, the application:
1. **Processes the input:** Uses a pre-trained preprocessor to transform the data.
2. **Predicts favorability:** Employs a logistic regression model to estimate the probability that the app is favorable on Google Play.
3. **Provides recommendations:** Compares user inputs against pre-determined threshold values for key metrics (e.g., optimal rating, price, update frequency, and app age) and suggests improvements.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GooglePlaySuccessDashboard.git
   cd GooglePlaySuccessDashboard
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Required Dependencies:**

   Ensure you have a `requirements.txt` file in the repository with the following dependencies (or similar):

   ```txt
   streamlit
   pandas
   numpy
   joblib
   ```

   Then, install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application:**

   Launch the Streamlit app on your local machine:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. **Access the Dashboard:**

   Once the command runs successfully, a local URL (usually [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)) will be provided. Open this URL in your browser to interact with the dashboard.

## Usage

- **Input your app’s details:** Fill in the form with your app's rating, price, age, time since the last update, content rating, and whether the app is free.
- **Evaluate the app:** Click the "Evaluate and Get Recommendations" button. The application will process your input, display the probability of favorability, and provide customized recommendations to enhance your app's appeal on Google Play.
- **Review recommendations:** The dashboard displays insights on key metrics such as rating, price, update frequency, and app age. It also calculates a composite improvement gap indicating how much the app deviates from the optimal thresholds.
